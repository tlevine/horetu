Produce a command-line interface from a Python function.

Consider the following Python program, called ``do_something.py``.

::
    
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    def main(input_file:partial(open, mode = 'rb'),
             output_file:partial(open, mode = 'wb'),
             n_cores = 3):
        '''
        Do something to a file with several cores.
        '''
        # Pretend that something happens here.
    horetu(main)

Run it with the help flag; this is the result.

    $ do_something.py --help
    usage: do_something.py [-h] [--n-cores N-CORES]
                           input-file output-file

    Do something to a file with several cores.
